# HTTP-proxy-server-application
Python socket programming is used, as is the HTTP protocol. The goal of this project was to create a network application utilising the stream socket API. Simple HTTP GET requests are supported by this application. Cases for handling errors have been implemented. The web pages are cached by the proxy.
